# Wick & Willow

Wick & Willow is a mockup webshop. The focus of this project was on the design, involving the creation of a graphic profile and logo using Illustrator, followed by the development of a wireframe and mockup of the web design using Photoshop. The website is non-interactive, serving as a visual representation from the mockup.
